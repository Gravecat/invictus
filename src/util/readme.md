# src/util

The util source folder contains largely generic, standalone utility functions which are used elsewhere in the code, but are not tied directly to one particular system.

* **filex.cpp** - Platform-agnostic file-handling functions.
* **strx.cpp** - String manipulation functions.
* **winx.cpp** - Windows-specific nightmare voodoo code.

# src/codex

The codex source folder is where the static game data resides -- it contains factory classes, which generate preset classes for tiles, items, monsters, etc.

* **codex-item.cpp** - Factory class, generating preset types of Items which can be used by the player or NPCs.

* **codex-monster.cpp** - Factory class, generating preset types of Monsters that occupy the game world.

* **codex-tile.cpp** - Factory class, generating preset types of Tiles that make up the game world's structure.

# src/world

The world source folder contains code that affects the game world as a whole, but doesn't belong in any other particular sub-folder.

* **tile.hpp** - The Tile class defines the blocks that make up the game world, be it floors, walls, doors, or whatever.
* **timing.hpp** - `constexpr` values for the time it takes to perform various actions in-game, or other fixed timing values.

# src/ui

The ui source folder contains code dealing with the UI elements of the game (the dungeon viewport, the message log, the sidebar, other overlapping windows),
along with menus, popup boxes, and other UI-like things.

* **ui.cpp** - The main manager class, which handles and renders the various UI elements.

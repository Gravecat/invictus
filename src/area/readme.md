# src/area

The area source folder contains the Area class (which defines dungeons, towns, and other regions in the game that the player can explore), as well as the Tile
class (Tiles are the component blocks that make up an Area), and anything directly related to these classes.

* **area.cpp** - The Area class, which defines an area in the game world that the player can move around in.

* **gen-dungeon.cpp** - The cool procedural dungeon area generator.

* **shadowcast.cpp** - Shadowcasting code, for calculating line-of-sight.

* **tile.cpp** - The Tile class, defining floors, walls, and other semi-permanent obstacles in the game.

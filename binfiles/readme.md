# binfiles

This folder contains files that are automatically included in the `bin` folder when compiling the project with CMake. Currently, the only files here are
PDCurses DLLs used by Windows builds, along with `bin-readme.txt` which is copied into the `bin` folder during the build process and renamed to `readme.txt`.
